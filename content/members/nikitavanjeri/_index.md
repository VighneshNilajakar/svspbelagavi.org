Hey there! I'm Nikita Tammani Vanjeri, an ECE branch student with a thirst for learning and a passion for innovation. 🚀 I've delved into the exciting world of Arduino programming, where I've discovered the joy of bringing electronics projects to life. 💡 Joining a club or community of Arduino enthusiasts has been a game-changer for me, opening up endless possibilities for creativity and collaboration. 🤖 When I'm not tinkering with Arduino, you'll find me dabbling in Python, eager to expand my coding skills. 🐍 I thrive on challenges and love finding innovative solutions to problems, especially when it involves working with hardware. 🔧 With strong communication skills and a knack for teamwork, I'm always ready to take on new opportunities and grow. 😊👩‍💻 Let's embark on this journey of exploration and innovation together!
