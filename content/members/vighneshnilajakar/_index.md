Hey there! 👋 I'm Vighnesh Nilajakar, your friendly neighborhood Learning Engineer on a mission in the vast realm of Electronics and Communication. 🚀

Coding is my jam! From Python sorcery to weaving the intricate threads of MySQL, HTML, and CSS, I'm all about that tech symphony. 🎻 But hey, it's not just about the code life. I've delved into the poetic elegance of the C language, mastered the art of version control with Git, and made Linux my trusted sidekick for two years – because why settle for an ordinary OS when you can penguin power your way through! 🐧

Curious to peek into my tech adventures?\
